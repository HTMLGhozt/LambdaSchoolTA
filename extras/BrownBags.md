# Brown Bags Checklist

# Student Info:

### What are brown bags?

Brown bags are 20 minute presentations on a topic of the student’s choosing. Tech related topics are encouraged but not required. Presentations may be slideshows, demos, personal projects or talks. When creating your brown bag, make sure to save the last 5 minutes for Q&A.

### When are brown bags?

Brown bags are Fridays at 12 PST. Three students will present to their classmates. Students will prepare their presentations in advance and be called upon on Friday morning to present later that day.

### Why do we do them? / Do I have to?

Brown bags are an opportunity to practice speaking to groups, get to know your classmates, and learn about something new. Student participation is strongly encouraged.

### Will they be recorded?

Yes. Recordings will be available to you and your classmates.

# For TAs:

Friday morning, if there’s no school-wide event scheduled for brown bags:

1. Ask for volunteers.
2. Contact 3 students and give them the opportunity to present.
    - If a student isn’t prepared or opts out, move on to the next student.
3. At 11:55 AM invite the students giving presentations to the zoom room.
    - Ask them to decide the order they'll present in.
    - Explain that you’ll post the link at 12 and give the first person the go-ahead once you hit record.
4. At 12 post the link to the class slack channel, #cs.
5. Create a thread in the class channel for questions (reserve #brownbag for school wide events).
6. During the presentation:
    - If they've been talking for 15 minutes and don’t appear to be wrapping up, let them know how much time they have left.
    - Help them take questions from the question thread by reading them in the order they were asked.
7. Introduce the next student.

### What do I do if no one will present?

- Give your TAs the opportunity to present their own brown bags.
- Give one yourself.
- Ask if there are staff members who’d like to give a talk or make an announcement.
- Use the time for projects or a Q&A with TAs.
