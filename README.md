## Special Thanks
This repository is based on a fantastic repository under the same name put together by [Patrick Kennedy](https://github.com/mixelPixel/LambdaSchoolTA).

Thank you Tai the Thai and all of the other TAs for answering all the questions I've ever had. Now and in the future.

[Lambda School](https://github.com/LambdaSchool) for giving me the opportunity to learn code and the knowledge I needed to write this markdown document.
